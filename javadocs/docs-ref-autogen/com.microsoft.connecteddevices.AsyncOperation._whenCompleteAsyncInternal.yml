  summary: >-
    <p>The whenComplete trio of functions (whenComplete(action), whenCompleteAsync(action), and whenCompleteAsync(action,Executor)) are similar to the handle functions. Upon successful or exceptional completion of this operation, the passed in action will be executed allowing both antecedent results and antecedent exceptions to be observed. Unlike handle, the results of the action do not propagate to dependent operations; they observe this stage's exception / result instead of the passed in action's </p>
