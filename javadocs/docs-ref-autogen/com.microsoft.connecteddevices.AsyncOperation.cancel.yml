  summary: >-
    <p>Attempts to cancel the future and stop waiting for a result. </p>

    <p>Cancelling an AsyncOperation causes any threads waiting for the future via get() to immediately receive a CancellationException. The operation execution is not interrupted, but any eventual result from a cancelled call will be ignored.</p>
