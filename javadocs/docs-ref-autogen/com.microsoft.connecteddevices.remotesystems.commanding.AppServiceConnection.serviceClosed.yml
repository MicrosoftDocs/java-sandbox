  summary: >-
    <p>Event for when connection to the app service closes. </p>

    <p>&gt; **Note:** On the client app, the "app service closed" event is not raised when the `close` method is called (by either the client or the host); it is only raised on the client app for unexpected connection interruptions. On the host app, the event _is_ raised when the client calls `close` (as well as for unexpected interruptions). </p>
